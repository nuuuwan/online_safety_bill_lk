1. Clearer Definitions: Some of the terms used in the Act, such as "coordinated inauthentic behaviour" and "inauthentic online account," could be defined more clearly to avoid potential ambiguity and misinterpretation.

2. Technological Updates: As technology evolves rapidly, the legislation should include a provision for regular updates to keep pace with technological advancements and emerging online threats.

3. Privacy Protection: The Act could include more explicit protections for user privacy, detailing when and how user data can be accessed or used in investigations.

4. Public Education: The Act could mandate the creation of public education campaigns to make internet users aware of their rights and responsibilities under the law.

5. Dispute Resolution: The Act could provide for a clear, accessible, and efficient dispute resolution process for conflicts arising from its implementation.
