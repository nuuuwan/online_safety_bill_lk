Areas for Improvement
1. Clarity on Decision-Making: While the document mentions that decisions are made by a majority vote, it could provide more details on how decisions are made when a consensus isn't reached, or in case of complex issues that might need a supermajority or unanimous vote.

2. Conflict of Interest: The document could provide a more comprehensive outline on how potential conflicts of interest are identified, managed, and disclosed among the Commission members.

3. Diversity: The legislation might benefit from a clause ensuring representation of diverse groups within the Commission members, including gender, ethnicity, and age.

4. Training: The legislation could include a provision for regular training and capacity building of the Commission members to ensure they are up-to-date with the latest developments in online safety.

5. Public Participation: The legislation could be improved by including mechanisms for public participation, such as public consultations or hearings, in the decision-making process of the Commission.
