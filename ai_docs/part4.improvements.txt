Improvements
1. Clarification of Terms: Certain terms such as "prohibited statement" could be defined more explicitly to ensure that the legislation is not misinterpreted or abused.

2. Technological Updates: The legislation should be regularly updated to keep pace with the rapid advancement of technology and the evolving nature of online communication.

3. Strengthening Privacy Protections: While the legislation addresses the issue of harmful online communication, it could provide stronger protections for user privacy, particularly in terms of the process for disclosing identity information.

4. Public Awareness: The government could do more to raise public awareness about the legislation and the processes involved in reporting and addressing prohibited online statements.

5. Providing Support for Victims: The legislation could include provisions for providing support and assistance to victims of prohibited online statements, such as counseling services or legal aid.
