Improvements
1. The bill could include more specific definitions of what constitutes "prohibited purposes" and "false statements of fact" to avoid potential misuse or misinterpretation.
2. It could provide clearer guidelines on how the Online Safety Commission will operate, including its powers, responsibilities, and the process for appointing members.
3. The legislation could include provisions for regular reviews and updates to ensure it remains effective and relevant in the face of rapidly evolving digital technologies.
4. It might benefit from including a section on public education and awareness to help citizens understand and comply with the new regulations. 
5. There could be more emphasis on protecting the rights to freedom of speech and privacy, to ensure these are not unduly compromised in the pursuit of online safety.
