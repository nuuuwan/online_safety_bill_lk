Part 6
 
Improvements
1. Clarification: The legislation could more clearly define what constitutes a "prohibited statement" and "coordinated inauthentic behavior". This would help ensure that the law is applied consistently and fairly.

2. Appeals Process: The legislation could include a more explicit appeals process for internet intermediaries who believe they have been wrongly accused or penalized.

3. Prevention Measures: The legislation could include provisions to encourage or require internet intermediaries to implement measures to prevent the creation of inauthentic accounts or the dissemination of prohibited statements.

4. Transparency: The legislation could require the Commission to publish regular reports on its enforcement of this legislation, to ensure transparency and accountability.

5. International Collaboration: Given the global nature of the internet, the legislation could include provisions for international collaboration and information sharing to more effectively counteract inauthentic online accounts and behaviors.
