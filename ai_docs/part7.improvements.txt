Improvements
1. The legislation could provide more specific qualifications or certification requirements for the appointed experts to ensure their competency and reliability.
2. The legislation could include more explicit privacy protections to prevent potential misuse of the broad powers granted to experts during investigations.
3. The legislation could establish a mechanism for oversight or accountability for the experts to prevent potential abuses of power.
4. The process for determining the remuneration of the experts could be made more transparent and fair, potentially by involving an independent body.
