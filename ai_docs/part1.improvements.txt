Part 1
 
Improvements
1. The legislation could benefit from a more detailed description of the qualifications required for the members of the Commission. The current description is quite broad and could be made more specific to ensure the most qualified individuals are selected.

2. The legislation could also provide a clearer process for handling conflicts of interest among the members of the Commission. While the document mentions financial conflicts of interest as a disqualifier, it does not provide a mechanism for identifying and managing potential conflicts.

3. It may be helpful to establish a process for public input or oversight to increase transparency and trust in the Commission.

4. The legislation could consider including a provision for regular review and updating of the Commission's mandate and operations to ensure it stays relevant in a rapidly changing online environment. 

5. The legislation might also benefit from including specific guidelines or criteria for what constitutes a "valid reason" for a member's absence from three consecutive meetings, to avoid potential misuse of this clause.
