Part 3
 
Improvements
1. Provide Clear Definitions: The legislation could be improved by providing clearer definitions of terms such as "false statement," "harassment," and "religious feelings." This would help to ensure that the law is applied consistently and fairly.

2. Address Privacy Concerns: The legislation could also address privacy concerns more explicitly. For example, it could provide guidelines for how personal information should be handled and protected online.

3. Include Provisions for Digital Literacy: The legislation could include provisions for promoting digital literacy and safe online behavior. This could help to prevent online misconduct in the first place.

4. Strengthen Enforcement Mechanisms: The legislation could also be improved by strengthening enforcement mechanisms. This could include providing more resources for investigating and prosecuting online misconduct.

5. Consider International Cooperation: Given the global nature of the internet, the legislation could include provisions for international cooperation in investigating and prosecuting online misconduct.
